<p><strong>Winform Progress Trackers</strong></p>
<p><em>My main design paradigm for this project, is to try and minimize the re-drawing of the objects as much as possible. i.e. use existing windows objects to control placement, Font usage, spacing, and only recreate images if a control re-size happens.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This project is going to take the useful indicators that are becoming common place on the web, and make them into dynamic controls for use in C# Winfom controls.</p>
<p>It will (<em>eventually</em>) have demo projects showing usage; and a simple <em>
HowTo</em> to extend projects like <a href="http://simplewizard.codeplex.com/">MBG.SimpleWizard
</a>to create easy to re-use controls for <em>wizard</em> steps, which will then auto populate (And hence progress) the Tracker as a single entity.</p>
<p>So here is a picture of a test App:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=trackers&DownloadId=627473" alt="" width="496" height="278"></p>
<p>It is showing that progress has got to what is called &ldquo;Page2b&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s style has a border (The other pages did not) and it has a few Winform objects on it that are responding to mouse over.</p>
<p>The node name is derived from the Pages name, and the initialisation (or override) is all done in the parent form that hosts the Wizard tracker.</p>
